Circuit Extras:
+ 1M Ohm resistor - BATT read
+ 220k Ohm resistor - BATT read
+ 1000uF cap for - LED strand
+ 470 Ohm resistor - LED strand (connected in line with the data line)




== TODOs ==

+ Get IMU online
+ Order parts


+ Pull in some Neopixel demo code
https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide/arduino-library-installation
+ Heart beat mode
+ Color on rotate mode
+ Shake fireflies
+ Control modes via MaxMSP


+ Look into using NRF24L01
+ Positional tracking in room?
+ How long will the battery last
+ Get proper resistor/cap setup for LEDs
+ Enable low power sleep mode - cross wiring
